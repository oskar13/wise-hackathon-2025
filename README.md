# Wise Achievements

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://wise-hackathon-2025.vercel.app/

## Pitch

Wise achievements introduce a fun layer on top of the app. Users unlock achievements by exploring different features of the app like ordering a debit card, making payments and donations.

To make achievements meaningful we introduce **Wise Coin** which can be used for all sorts of things on the platform like discounts for fees, exclusive merch, ordering custom designs for your card.

## Helps Users Get More Value Out of Wise With Less Effort

Most users don't explore all of Wise's capabilities. Achievements guide them naturally:

> Order your card → activate it → make your first payment

It's not gamification for its own sake, it's **progressive onboarding disguised as fun**. Helping the user unlock money-saving features they would have otherwise missed.

## Encourages Smart Behaviors

Achievements can promote actions like:

- Spending in local currencies
- Avoiding fees abroad
- Watching exchange rates
